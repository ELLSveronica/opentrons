Running a Protocol
================================

Now that you have your protocol, it's time to run it on your robot!


Saving the File
-------------------------------
File Type
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Protocols should be saved as a .py file.

What to Keep
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The only cells you need to run the .py file via the app are the import cell, container cell and commands cel.  You can comment out all the pip installs and any robot commands (robot.run, robot.commands etc.)


Start App
